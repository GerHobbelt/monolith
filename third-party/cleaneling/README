These are the sources of the SAT solver Cleaneling.  It is an attempt to
produce a clean version of Lingeling, where 'clean' means easy to read,
understand and adapt.  It does not strive for the same goal as Lingeling to be
as efficient as possible, particularly with respect to memory usage.

To compile run './configure.sh && make'.  If you want to include debugging
code use './configure -g && make' instead.
